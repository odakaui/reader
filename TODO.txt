Punctuation (PUNCT)

Punctuation tokens are legal until a non punctuation character is added.
    Once a non punctuation character is added, if another punctuation character is added, the word will end before the next non punctuation character.

    "。。。ああああああ。。あ" 

    The word will end right before the last "a" character.
    Once the word contains both a non punctuation character and a punctuation character, punctuation becomes the only legal character.



Terms (VERB, NOUN, ADJ, ADJNOUN)

A term token is legal until a term is added.
    Once a term is added, the word will end before the next term.
    Only one term is allowed per word.



Filler

Filler tokens are always legal unless another rule states otherwise.
